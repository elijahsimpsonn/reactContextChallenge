# REACT CONTEXT CHALLENGE

<p>The code shows a simple React app that displays a value within a state. It is being passed down through multiple components, which is resulting in prop drilling. Your task is to refactor this app using Context.</p>

<p>The result at the end should render the name, age, and role that is within the context. You can display this as either list items or paragraphs.</p>

<p>BONUS CHALLENGE - Create a button that when pressed increases the age value by 1.</p>

<p>HINTS - Remember that we need to use React.createContext() and use .Provider to provide the data from the context and .Consumer to use the data from it.</p>
